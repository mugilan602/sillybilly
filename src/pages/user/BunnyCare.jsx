                "Aspen wood shaving is a type of wood shaving litter that is safe for rabbits. It usually does a very good job at odor control. However, it’s not the most absorptive litter, which means you’ll have to use a lot of it. Aspen shavings can also have a strong scent, which can deter some rabbits from using the litter box. Pine and Cedar shavings are not safe and hence best to avoid. If you have to use Pine, you can cover it up with a thick layer or straw or shredded paper. Alternatively, horse bedding can also be used as it's absorbent, natural, and biodegradable.",

                "These are typically made of 100% recycled paper that is compressed into absorptive pellets. They are great at absorbing rabbit urine, so you don’t need to use as much on a daily basis. It can absorb up to 400% more than the traditional clay or wood-based litters. Pellets are so absorbent that they do not break apart when wet or cake to the bottom of the litter pan. This leaves a much healthier environment for your rabbits and clean up is much easier.",

                "Yesterday’s newspaper or the most commonly sold paper-based litter from pet stores are good options. Rabbits are natural foragers and may nibble on their bedding. Choosing a bedding made from natural materials will ensure that your rabbit is not exposed to any harmful chemicals or toxins. It is cheaper and also promotes a more natural and eco-friendly living environment for your pet. I generally don’t recommend shredded newspaper because it doesn’t absorb rabbit urine easily. Last resort - Hay can be used but it is not absorbent and calls for a frequent clean up.",

                        <li>A proper balanced diet is crucial for the rabbit's health. It should consist of copious hay, fresh vegetables, and a measured amount of high-quality pellets.</li>
                        <li>Rabbits need to have their body weights equivalent in hay every day. The high fiber content helps keep their digestive tracts moving and to keep their ever-growing teeth ground down.</li>
                        <li>The most common rabbit health problems are gastrointestinal issues and dental disease. Insufficient hay is often the key contributing factor in each of these widespread problems. Feeding 80% hay is preventative health care.</li>
                        <li>Timothy hay for adult rabbits and Alfalfa hay for baby rabbits under 6 months.</li>
                        <li>No fruits, veggies, or treats until after 6 months of age.</li>
                        <li>Rabbit pellets provide the needed vitamins, calcium, and proteins. 1/4 cup per day is recommended.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rabbits should not be given excess carrots.</strong> No matter what cartoons may tell you, rabbits can get diabetes from eating them in large portions. Leafy greens, fruits, and veggies in moderation help to keep their diet balanced.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Rabbits enjoy attention & love interacting with their owners.</li>
                        <li>Have plenty of toys for stimulation and to prevent boredom.</li>
                        <li>Rabbits love hiding places. Sometimes, they just need a space to take a breather.</li>
                        <li>
                            Some rabbits do not enjoy being picked up. Give them time to approach you and get down to the bunny's level.
                        </li>
                        <li>Rabbits need to have their nails trimmed every 2 months. YouTube is a great resource on how to do it yourself.</li>
                        <li>
                            Rabbits startle easily and can die of fright. If you are planning to cause a lot of noise (e.g., a party, fireworks),
                            keep the bunny away from the noise.
                        </li>
                        <li>Rabbits are very sensitive to heat. They cannot be in direct sunlight and will die of heat stroke.</li>
                        <li>
                            Rabbits need at least 4 hours of exercise a day; they cannot be at their best health if kept in cramped cages all day.
                        </li>
                        <li>Bunnies will chew on threads and wires. Keep them out of your bunny’s reach!</li>
                        <li>
                            Your bunny licking you is a sign of love. Zoomies are when they run super-fast. Binkies are when they jump and kick
                            their feet out. These mean your bunny is excited and happy. A bunny flops when content and relaxed, laying stretched
                            out on their side.
                        </li>

                        <li>There is no approved/licensed rabies vaccine for rabbits. So vaccination is not mandated for bunnies in Canada.</li>
                        <li>Bunnies should be dewormed if you notice a weight loss, excess scratching, or fur loss.</li>
                        <li>Nails need to be trimmed every 2 months - Check a YouTube tutorial and follow it!</li>
                        <li>Long-haired bunnies should be brushed every week or two to remove loose fur, which could otherwise get stuck in their intestines.</li>
                        <li>No bunny baths, but spot cleaning is recommended if they get soiled.</li>
                        <li>Feeding plenty of hay and providing apple tree twigs for chewing will help to prevent their teeth from growing.</li>
                        <li>
                            Some red alert signs to watch for are grinding sound of teeth, messy poopy back, noticeable weight loss, scratching excessively, increased water consumption, and lethargy.
                            Bunnies are excellent at hiding their sickness, so if you notice any of the above, a vet visit is immediately needed.

                    <h3 className="text-md lg:text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Before you begin litter training your pet rabbit, there are a few things to keep in mind:</h3>
                    <ul className="text-md list-disc pl-4 lg:pl-5 lg:space-y-1">
                        <li>By nature, most rabbits will choose to relieve themselves in the same place.</li>
                        <li>They pee and poop to mark their territory. Spaying and neutering greatly reduces this urge and therefore helps with litter training.</li>
                        <li>At times a spayed/neutered rabbit will still drop dry poops, but it will be much less than before.</li>
                        <li>Rabbits are seriously poop machines and can even poop in their sleep!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 className="text-md lg:text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">How to train your rabbit:</h3>
                    <ul className="text-md list-disc pl-4 lg:pl-5 lg:space-y-1">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Set up a litter box:</strong> Use a spacious shallow box and fill it with a layer of litter about two to three inches deep.
                            Add a thick layer of hay at one end of the litter box or in a hay feeder hung directly above the litter box so your rabbit
                            can munch while still in the box. Rabbits like to eat and go to the bathroom at the same time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>A COMMON MISTAKE</strong> is spreading a layer of litter/bedding material along your rabbit’s enclosure floor.
                            <strong>Do NOT do this!</strong> Your bunny will be confused where to go to the bathroom! Litter goes in the litter box only.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Identify their preferred toileting area:</strong> Rabbits often go to the bathroom in a corner.
                            Identify the corner and set up the litter box in that corner. Bunny chooses, not you!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Start by adding urine-soaked bedding or poop</strong> to the litter box to show them it’s the toilet.
                            Until your bunny consistently uses the litter box, don't completely clean all of the soiled litter each day.
                            Leave a small amount of residue to help them associate the litter box with their scent.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Reduce their space:</strong> Keep your rabbit in their housing area during training until they use the litter box reliably.
                            Once the rabbit is consistent, you can increase their living space.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Reward your rabbit:</strong> Offer a treat when your rabbit uses the litter box.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Clean accidents:</strong> Use a pet urine cleaner or white vinegar mixed with water to clean up messes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Large enclosures</strong> with multiple levels will need more than one litter box.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Be patient:</strong> It can take some time for your rabbit to learn new habits.
                        </li>
